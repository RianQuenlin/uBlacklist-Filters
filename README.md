# uBlacklist-Filters
My filters for uBlacklist, focusing on fake transparancy image sites, but also trash blogs, hate sites/forums, and general garbage I come across. Subscribe to these if you want, but note that the subscription will be fueled by what I consider to be garbage, opinions will differ.

See the uBlacklist repository here: https://github.com/iorate/uBlacklist
